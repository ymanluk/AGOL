If the hosted pictures can't be accessed, they won't be available in the Map Tour and you'll see a 'Picture not available' image. Depending on your photo service provider, the Map Tour may not import the name, description, and location of the pictures. Those attributes are stored in the web map and any edits to the online services won't be reflected in the Map Tour.",

					div13: "If you have existing place data, such as a list of places in a spreadsheet or a GIS point layer, you can use that data in CSV format to create a Map Tour. This requires that your pictures are accessed directly via URLs that are stored as values in the CSV file. You can download the CSV template from the Advanced options dialog when you first launch the Map Tour Builder. Your CSV file can be uploaded into that dialog.",

The Map Tour will continue to use the pictures and thumbnails you have referenced through attributes.

					div20: "Supported picture formats and videos",

If you upload images into the Map Tour builder, the images have to be in .jpg, or .jpeg format. If you reference images directly on the web via their URLs, supported picture formats are .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif and .bmp. YouTube videos are supported directly.",
					div22: "The Map Tour template doesn't include a video player, so you have to use the external video player provided by your favorite video hosting service (find the option to embed the video and copy the URL present in the given code).

					div23: "The interactive builder doesn't provide a dialog to include video when using feature services with attachments, but it is possible to do so by editing your data outside of the interactive builder. In the arcgis.com map viewer, if you modify the picture fields to point to an external video and add a special parameter at the end of your URL (#isVideo), your media will be considered to be a video.",

					div43: "Note that the interactive builder is available in the downloadable version but with some technical restrictions on browsers like Internet Explorer older than version 10.",
					div5: "To download the most recent version of the template and learn more about how to use it, visit the <a href='https://github.com/Esri/map-tour-storytelling-template-js' target='_blank'>GitHub project page</a>."

				tab4: {
					title: "Tips",
					div0: "Supported browsers",
					div0a: "The Map Tour viewer is supported on IE8+. The interactive builder is supported on IE9+. We actively test it in all major browsers but if you experience some difficulties, we recommend that you use Chrome.",
					div0b: "If you experience some difficulties, please let us know. In the meantime, by building your Map Tour using the CSV template you will minimize your interaction with the builder interface.",
					div1: "Images",
					div2: "Although images of different sizes, shapes, and orientation can be used in one Map Tour, we recommend landscape orientation images instead of portrait orientation. Images with a 4:3 aspect ratio fit best. In the Three Panel and Integrated layouts, in which the caption overlaps the image, using portrait orientation images can result in a lot of the image being obscured by the caption. In the Three Panel and Integrated layouts we recommend using the same size and shape for all the images if possible. In this way, the user won't be distracted by different sized images as they go through the tour.",
					div2a: "We recommend a maximum image size of 1000 pixels wide x 750 pixels tall for the main pictures and 140x93 for the thumbnails.",
					div3: "Formatting your caption text using HTML tags",
					div4: "You can enter HTML tags into your captions to define formatting and links. For example, these tags add a green hyperlink:",
					div4aa: "<b>Create a cover page for your Side Panel tour</b><br>The Side Panel layout supports an optional cover page so you can grab your audience's attention with a great looking, full-screen image. To configure the cover page for a Side Panel tour, first add some or all of your points into your tour. Then click the Organize button, and in the dialog that appears make sure that the tour point that you want to use to define the cover page is the first point in your tour. Then click the 'Use the first point as a cover page' box in that dialog. The name of your first tour point will become the title shown on the cover page, the caption for that point will become the subtitle, and that point's image will used as the cover page image. Video is not supported in the cover page. See this <a href='https://links.esri.com/storymaps/faq_map_tour_cover_page_sp' target='_blank'>FAQ</a> for more info.</a>",
					div4a: "Write a good subtitle for your tour",
					div4b: "Take time to write a compelling subtitle for your tour. The subtitle is a good way to draw people into your tour and tell them what they will discover in it. It is also a good place to tell your audience the state or country that the tour is located in. For example don't assume that people know where the city or town in your tour is located. Don't make the subtitle too long though. If you can't think of a good subtitle, leave it blank. Unlike the Three Panel and Integrated layouts, the Side Panel layout doesn't support a subtitle in its header. If you use the cover page option in the Side Panel layout, the caption for the first point in your tour is shown on the cover page and so serves as the subtitle for your tour.",
					div5: "Supporting Layers",
					div6: "You can add additional supporting layers to provide context to the Map Tour. These layers may contain other geographic features you want the map to show in addition to the Map Tour points, such as a study area, a walking or driving route linking your tour points, etc. The Map Tour template displays these additional supporting layers using the symbology you specify in the web map, but any popups defined for layers aren't supported.  To add supporting layers to your tour, save your work and close the Map Tour Builder. Then open the web map used in your tour. You can find this in ArcGIS My Content or via the My Stories section of the Story Maps website.",
					div7: "Keep your tour short and sweet",
					div8: "There's a limit of 99 points per tour. Most Map Tours will of course be significantly shorter than this. Don't expect your audience to want to step through too many tour points. You might find your subject fascinating, but don't assume they will, too!",
					div10: "Embed mode",
					div11: "If you want to embed the template in another website through an iframe, adding the optional parameter \"&embed\" at the end of the URL will remove the header.",
					div12: "Avoid using a narrow iFrame width that causes the map tour to switch to its responsive small display view, which is the same view the tour uses on mobile devices. To maximize ease of use, when you embed a map tour, we always recommend still providing a link next to the embedded tour so that users can launch the tour full-screen."

If you have added others layers through ArcGIS.com map viewer, they won't be updated. This can result in the Tour not being shared as you expect. Items that already have the required (or more) privileges won't be updated.",

					div3t2: "Before sharing your Tour with your audience",
					div3: "Make sure the Tour works well when you are not signed in with your ArcGIS.com account. The URL you are going to use should not redirect to a login page or to the builder mode.",
					div4: "It is a good idea to see what your map tour looks like on an iPad held in landscape orientation to make sure it looks good on this popular device. This can help you see if your captions cover up too much of the pictures. It also lets you see if your subtitle fits and isn't so long that it gets clipped.",
					div5a: "Recommendation for search",
					div5b: "To help people find your Map Tour if they search in ArcGIS Online, we recommend that you add the tag 'story map' into your map tour's application item page (not your web map's item page), along with tags such as the name of the state or province where the tour is located, the country name if it is outside the USA, and thematic tags like 'public art', 'tourist guide' or 'historic places'. These tags also help us at Esri to find cool new examples of tours we can showcase in our galleries and promote in social media. We also recommend that you upload a nice looking thumbnail graphic into your application item page, such as a small screenshot of the tour or one of the pictures from it. This picture is used automatically if your map tour is added into an ArcGIS Online gallery."
